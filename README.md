# The Macro Nutrient Balancer

https://lbuthman.github.io/macro-balancer/

Specially designed and created for the Moves Method Inner Circle.

## How it works

1. Enter the grams of Protein, Carbohydrates, and Fats you have consumed.
2. Get Feedback on your Macro Nutrient Balance:
   1. The Target is 30% Protein, 40% Carbohydrates, and 30% Fats.
   2. Green = 0-2% on target (plus or minus)
   3. Yellow = 3-5%
   4. Red = >5% 
3. Immediately get recommendations on how to balance your intake.
4. Optionally set a Caloric Deficit percentage (0% to 30%)
   * This will provide your new target calories and macro nutrient breakdown.
